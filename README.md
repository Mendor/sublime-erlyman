sublime-erlyman
===============

Erlang manual pages navigation plugin for Sublime Text, currently in beta.

Works only on Linux and MacOSX due to official Erlang ``-man`` key limitation.

Should be installed to ``Packages/Erlyman`` directory inside your ST config directory (e.g. ``~/.config/sublimt-text-2`` in Linux by default).

Use F1 by default to list documented Erlang modules and Ctrl+R inside pages for quick function search.

Use Alt+F1 (or Ctrl+F1 on MacOSX) when the text cursor is on function call for this function reference.

Details coming soon.
